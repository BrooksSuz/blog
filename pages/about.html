            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in Northwest Ohio. After graduating from
              high school in the area, I went to study at the University of
              Toledo.
            </p>

            <p>
              College was confusing, difficult, and also very fun (side note for
              those that notice, I'm a fan of Oxford commas; I do not
              apologize). I changed majors several times. I knew what I wanted
              to study, but I knew that if I pursued it, I'd have to figure out
              my career path after graduation. Passion ended up beating
              practicality and I left UT with a Philosophy degree and just as
              much confusion as when I entered college.
            </p>

            <p>
              My life after college began with the hospitality job that I worked
              throughout my time at UT. I spent less than a year there and then
              pivoted into a substitute teaching job. I also took on a remote
              intern position studying mindfulness at the Unviersity of Michigan
              at this time (though this position was unpaid and ended up not
              being what I was looking for).
            </p>

            <p>
              The teaching role was one of the most fulfilling jobs I've ever
              had. It was also one of the worst jobs I've ever had for my mental
              health. It took one really bad day and I decided right then and
              there that I couldn't handle working in a school. During my lunch
              break that day, I researched what I could study for free to put me
              on a better career path for myself. That moment was the beginning
              of my coding journey. I spent a school year there while also
              learning to code and then left with no job in mind. Luckily, my
              mom was a mail carrier at the time and showed me a job posting for
              a part-time clerk position.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Postal Service also had its ups and downs. Ultimately, the
              position was useful for what it was. It kept some money in my
              pocket and helped me pay off my student loans. With it being a
              part-time job, I was able to dedicate a lot of time during those
              days to study web development.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I felt ready enough, I put together a portfolio, I created my
              first "all by myself" web project, and I slapped that project on
              the portfolio (as well as a little weather app I made, so I at
              least had two projects on the portfolio).
            </p>

            <p>
              I applied to over one hundred companies over seven months. Of
              those applications, three companies reached back out to me. Two of
              them brought me in for two rounds of interviews. Unfortunately,
              both of those companies didn't reach out to me after those
              interviews. The third company brought me in for two interviews and
              offered me a job!
            </p>

            <p>
              I left the Postal Service full of excitement for what lied ahead!
            </p>

            <p>
              Now I work as a Project Developer learning about "all things
              coding" every single day. I love this profession and I still
              continue to study web development on my own when I have the time
              and mental capacity to do so.
