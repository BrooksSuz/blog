						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
							I was born and raised in Northwest Ohio. After graduating from
							high school in the area, I went to study at the University of
							Toledo.
						</p>

						<p>
							College was confusing, difficult and also very fun. I changed
							majors several times. I knew what I wanted to study, but I knew
							that if I pursued it, I'd have to figure out my career path after
							graduation. Passion ended up beating practicality and I left UT
							with a philosophy degree and just as much confusion as when I
							entered college.
						</p>

						<p>
							After college, I jumped back into the Marina Attendant position I
							had been working throughout my time at university. I spent less
							than a year there and then pivoted into a substitute teaching
							role. Also during this time, I took on a remote intern position
							studying mindfulness at the University of Michigan.
						</p>

						<p>
							The teaching role was one of the most fulfilling positions I've
							ever had. It was simultaneously one of the worst jobs I've ever
							had for my mental health. It took one really bad day and I decided
							that I couldn't handle working in a school. I needed to pivot.
						</p>

						<p>
							I've always loved working with technology, but never found the
							right fit for myself. During my lunch break on that rough school
							day, I researched what I could study for free. I stumbled into
							free web development resources, was intrigued by the content
							immediately and thought to myself, "alright, you're going to see
							this through."
						</p>

						<p>
							I spent the rest of the school year learning about web development
							in my free time. Once the school year came to a close, I was able
							to acquire a part-time position with the United States Postal
							Service while I continued to study.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Postal Service also wasn't easy, but it provided me with some
							money and helped me pay off my student loans. With it being a
							part-time job, I was able to dedicate large amounts of time
							outside of work to study web development.
						</p>

						<p>
							When I felt ready, I put together a portfolio and began applying.
						</p>

						<p>The rest is history!</p>

						<p>
							Now I work as a developer learning about code every single day. I
							couldn't love it more! I continue to study web development on my
							own with the goal of improving my skills slowly, but surely.
