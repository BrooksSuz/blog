							<h2>Locality of Behavior</h2>
							<span>Sep 16th, 2023</span>
						</div>
						<p>
							Today's post will touch on the software development principle
							called Locality of Behavior (LoB).
							<a
								href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/"
								target="_blank"
								>This essay</a
							>
							is what I will be referencing.
						</p>

						<p>
							Software development principles are guidelines that developers may
							choose to follow with the intention of making their code more
							maintainable, easier to understand, efficient and so on. As a
							developer, it's good to have an understanding of at least one or
							two principles in order to keep the chaos that can come from
							unorganized code at bay. This is especially true for developers
							that work on the same codebase.
						</p>

						<p>
							I learned about LoB from reading
							<a
								href="https://grugbrain.dev/"
								target="_blank"
								>this fun article</a
							>
							by Carson Gross. LoB is one of the many topics Gross touches on in
							the article. I encourage all to read it.
						</p>

						<p>
							The general goal of LoB is simple. Developers should create code
							that's easy to understand and maintain. This is accomplished by
							keeping code behavior within units of code (I'll be referring to
							them as units). Generally speaking, the farther away the unit is
							(where it's implemented) from its behavior (the unit's original
							declaration/functionality), the harder it is to understand what is
							happening within the unit.
						</p>

						<p>
							I find it easier to understand LoB by contrasting it with another
							principle called
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"
								target="_blank"
								>Separation of Concerns</a
							>
							(SoC). LoB and SoC have different approaches to accomplish similar
							goals. As a disclaimer, they are not exact opposites. I'm
							contrasting them as a means to further understanding of them both.
							It's probable that both principles can be implemented in a
							codebase and make sense.
						</p>

						<p>
							SoC organizes code based upon
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concern_(computer_science)"
								target="_blank"
								>concern</a
							>. One of the clearest displays of SoC in my opinion is found in
							the core web stack. HTML is concerned with structuring a web
							application, CSS with designing, and JavaScript with adding
							additional functionality. Each language affects the code
							differently. Thus, it's common to separate each language into
							their own file(s)/folder(s). This blog's code is organized with
							SoC in mind!
						</p>

						<p>
							It's easy to see the strengths with this approach. Mixing concerns
							together may add confusion. This is one reason why frontend
							developers don't typically write their HTML elements with CSS
							styles inline. That being said, things change and now
							<a
								href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
								target="_blank"
								>Tailwind CSS</a
							>
							is a very popular CSS framework.
						</p>

						<p>
							LoB on the other hand takes a different approach. Rather than
							organizing code by concern, it organizes code based upon a unit's
							behavior. The thought behind this principle is that a unit is best
							understood by looking at nothing more than that specific unit.
							This approach welcomes (and even encourages) the mixing of various
							programming languages into a single unit if doing so keeps its
							behavior inside itself.
						</p>

						<p>
							This approach does call to question when (if at all) a developer
							should rely upon
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)"
								target="_blank"
								>abstraction</a
							>. Gross suggests that abstractions are okay when implemented
							carefully (and not in excess). Gross states, "it is important to
							make the distinction between inlining the implementation of some
							behaviour and inlining the invocation (or declaration) of some
							behaviour." In other words, there is a difference between
							declaring a function and invoking one. A function that abstracts
							away complicated logic in its declaration, and is invoked in an
							obvious manner, strives toward LoB's goal of keeping code easy to
							understand. Even though creating abstractions innately goes
							against the main premise of LoB, they are still useful when
							applied strategically and not in excess.
						</p>

						<p>
							Code implemented with SoC in mind often use abstractions. This
							typically means that developers rely on several files to
							understand what a single unit does. Gross refers to this phenomena
							as "spooky action at a distance."
						</p>

						<p>
							LoB attempts to eliminate as much "spooky action at a distance" as
							possible. Sometimes, this means going against the
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"
								target="_blank"
								>DRY principle</a
							>. LoB takes into consideration that it's better to repeat code
							occasionally than to rely on code that is nested far away from
							where it's being implemented.
						</p>

						<p>
							Realistically, it's best to write code that is understood by the
							most amount of people. For those that work with multiple other
							developers, they should follow the conventions that are set in
							place by their peers. For solo projects, I still advise developers
							to follow best practices as often as possible (for their own
							sake). But hey, everyone has their own interpretations of what is
							considered to be "best."
						</p>

						<p>
							I've only recently learned about LoB. I'm very interested in
							implementing more of it. I can see this principle being easier to
							implement in code using single-page application frameworks since
							they, by nature of their design, encourage developers to keep both
							the structure and functionality of their code in the same place.
							Luckily for me, I love working with
							<a
								href="https://react.dev/"
								target="_blank"
								>React</a
							>. So I think I'll be able to implement LoB quite a bit going
							forward!
