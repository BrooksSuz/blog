							<h2>Introduction to TypeScript</h2>
							<span>Dec 9th, 2023</span>
						</div>
						<p>
							Hello all! I've recently been learning TypeScript. It's something
							I've wanted to do for quite some time now, so I'm happy that I'm
							setting aside time to do so!
						</p>

						<p>
							This post will briefly introduce TypeScript. Currently, I'm still
							a novice. However, since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript (a
							language I feel quite comfortable with), and since I feel very
							comfortable with
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking"
								target="_blank"
								>static typing</a
							>
							from learning C# in my current workplace, I feel confident that
							I'll learn TypeScript quite quickly and will thank myself for
							doing so in the future! Before jumping directly in, I do want to
							begin by describing why TypeScript is a useful addition to
							JavaScript.
						</p>

						<p>
							Also, as a quick disclaimer, all of the information regarding
							TypeScript comes from what I have learned by using TypeScript, as
							well as from the
							<a
								href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html"
								target="_blank"
								>JavaScript portion of the docs</a
							>.
						</p>

						<p>
							JavaScript is what's known as a
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing"
								target="_blank"
								>loosely (or weakly...or dynamically) typed language</a
							>. Per the wiki page I provided, "A weakly typed language has
							looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable or even
							erroneous results or may perform implicit type conversion at
							runtime. Advocates of dynamically typed languages find such
							concerns to be overblown and believe that static typing actually
							introduces an exponentially larger set of problems and
							inefficiencies."
						</p>

						<p>
							That portion of the wiki sheds light on both the pros and cons of
							loosely typed languages. Speaking as someone who learned to code
							using JavaScript, I understand the many opinions on loosely typed
							languages.
						</p>

						<p>
							For those who are brand new to programming in general, I would
							recommend them to start with a loosely typed language. Learning to
							code is already a monumental task in and of itself. A loosely
							typed language has a lower barrier of entry and gets new
							programmers writing code that much faster.
						</p>

						<p>Alrighty, back on track.</p>

						<p>
							Like I said before, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This
							simply means it's built on top of JavaScript. It has all of the
							features that JavaScript contains and more!
						</p>

						<p>
							TypeScript determines types by inference. The old saying of, "if
							it looks like a duck" applies here because TypeScript will infer
							types based upon what the variable "looks" like. Take the
							following variable declaration for instance:
						</p>

						<p>let str = "Hello Reader!";</p>

						<p>
							TypeScript determines types based upon contextual information. In
							the example above, the inference was determined by the variable
							declaration. Though, if the developer prefers to manually input
							types, that's also possible.
						</p>

						<p>
							Speaking of static typing, TypeScript gives the power of static
							typing to the loosely typed language that is JavaScript! With it,
							the developer has a firm distinction between data types in their
							JavaScript code. This distinction will help prevent bugs arising
							in the future.
						</p>

						<p>
							TypeScript also introduces interface declarations. Interface
							declarations are quite useful for declaring an "abstract" for an
							object before creating the object itself. The following code
							displays an example interface:
						</p>

						<p>
							interface Pet {<br /><span style="margin-left: 1rem"
								>name: string;</span
							><br /><span style="margin-left: 1rem">age: number;</span><br />}
						</p>

						<p>
							That interface can now be used to create a "Pet" object. If a
							"Pet" object is declared incorrectly, TypeScript will display a
							warning message. Interfaces require more code upfront for less
							hassle in debugging later.
						</p>

						<p>
							Following that thought, a big part of TypeScript (and statically
							typed languages in general) is that more code now is better than
							more bugs later. For smaller-midsized projects, vanilla JavaScript
							is less of a hassle. For larger projects, TypeScript will
							certainly help reduce the amount of debugging required.
						</p>

						<p>
							There's still quite a bit to TypeScript I haven't touched on.
							TypeScript's typing system and interface declarations will get
							novice TypeScript users like myself quite far in their TypeScript
							projects. So, I think I'll leave it at that.
						</p>
