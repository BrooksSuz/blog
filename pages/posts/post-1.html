							<h2>JavaScript Injected CSS</h2>
							<span>Aug 12th, 2023</span>
						</div>
						<p>
							I recently acquired my first job as a developer. So far, it has
							been such a great experience! My first project with the company
							has been to update a search modal the company uses for their
							salable products.
						</p>

						<p>
							I have built the modal from the ground up. The project has taken
							me a little over a week to get all of the JavaScript working
							properly and to style the modal along the way.
						</p>

						<p>
							I have to say, styling has become one of my favorite parts of the
							web development process. It is the cherry on top of a functional
							project that makes it <em>feel</em> like a functional project.
						</p>

						<p>
							In working on this project, I had attempted to insert a simple
							animation that would make the modal gradually expand when the
							container element is filled with child nodes. In my stylesheet, I
							used a keyframe that changes the max height CSS property from zero
							to the desired max height. And it worked...sort of.
						</p>

						<p>
							I had encountered that the animation would only work properly if
							the container element would expand to the max height value that I
							set inside of the keyframe. Since this wasn't always the case (the
							modal could contain one to as many possible child nodes as the
							search allowed) the animation at smaller heights would end
							abruptly before the set max height value was reached. This
							resulted in the animation at smaller heights to look clunky.
						</p>

						<p>
							This is by design. CSS implemented using stylesheets, the HTML
							style tag, or inline HTML elements, will be set to those values
							and will not change.
						</p>

						<p>
							This is normally a good effect. Certainly, there are properties
							that are more flexible than others (in my case, the max height
							property is a smidge more flexible than the normal height
							property). However, the property is still set to an unchanging
							value. This is the core of my issue.
						</p>

						<p>
							At first, I was stuck and tried a few fixes...to no avail. I
							played around with different max height values. I attempted using
							different CSS properties altogether (both the height and min
							height properties).
						</p>

						<p>
							I slowly began to realize that the animation needed to be dynamic
							based upon how big the container element became.
						</p>

						<p>
							As it turns out, whenever a developer wants something that is
							dynamic, they have to reach into the "do stuff" portion of their
							code. To solve my issue, I needed to add the CSS dynamically using
							JavaScript.
						</p>

						<p>
							I had known about adding CSS using JavaScript before beginnning
							this project. However, it didn't occur to me at first that this
							was a property that could be manipulated (so I didn't even
							consider this method). Once I fully understood what I wanted out
							of my code, I began working.
						</p>

						<p>
							I first created a function that accepts one argument (the amount
							of immediate child nodes inside of the container element). The
							function contains a switch statement that would return a specific
							max height in pixels depending upon the integer passed into the
							function.
						</p>

						<p>
							Then, I created another function that accepts a single argument
							(the return value of the previous function). Inside of this
							function, I created a keyframe rule using JavaScript's template
							literal syntax (`Example string ${exampleVariable}`) and stored it
							into a variable. Inside the keyframe, I passed the max height
							variable into the "to" section. I then passed the keyframe
							variable into the proper stylesheet. Finally, I finished it all by
							adding the animation rules.
						</p>

						<p>
							This little part of my project has changed the way I approach
							coding in general. I learned that it is better to think about what
							I want out of my code before writing any. I needed a dynamic
							animation, but didn't consider using JavaScript until I finally
							realized what I wanted my code to do.
