              Git is a technology that has benefited me greatly from learning
              (and I assume any developer for that matter). It is functionally a
              save button for developers. When first learning to code, I relied
              almost exclusively on "undoing" to save myself from unfortunate
              mistakes. What a terrible time that was. Now if I make mistakes, I
              don't have to rapidly spam my text editor with "ctrl + z" (though
              I still find myself doing this from time to time).
            </p>

            <p>
              Git Aliases have become one of my favorite aspects of Git. They
              are that additional feature that makes maintaining code feel like
              much less of a hassle.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before I get into explaining what Git Aliases are and why they're
              useful, I'd like to briefly explain what Git even is and the
              relationship between Git and a remote repository service.
            </p>

            <p>
              Git is used on a local machine (a computer). The developer uses
              Git by entering Git Commands on their command line to prepare text
              files for editing or saving (and probably other neat purposes I
              have yet to discover). Git is best paired with a remote repository
              service that stores developers' local repositories online and
              allows them to share their work with other developers, backup
              their projects online, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              GitHub is by far the most commonly used repository hosting
              service. To be frank, in my short time of being a developer, I am
              not very aware of other repository hosting services. I have only
              ever encountered other developers using GitHub. So I feel no need
              to use an alternative.
            </p>

            <p>
              The combination of Git and GitHub together is a form of version
              control. They work in tandem to act as one of the many
              technologies that help create more structure in a codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are a handful of Git Commands that are used most commonly.
              Using these commands, developers will find a workflow that feels
              the best for their specific needs. This means that they are
              constantly repeating certain commands all day, every day.
            </p>

            <p>This leads me into Git Aliases.</p>

            <p>
              Git Aliases are exactly what they sound like. Aliases for any Git
              Command they are assigned to. Aliases normally take the form of
              only a handful of letters or short phrases. They are helpful for
              reducing keystrokes for common commands.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, I would commonly use the command "git commit -m"
              followed with a message that describes what that commit is
              accomplishing (commits are the "saves" in Git). An alias for this
              could look like "ci = commit -m." Instead of writing the entire
              command, now the command gets replaced with "ci" followed by the
              commit message.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of my favorite Git Commands to use is "commit --amend -C
              HEAD." This command "adds" the code into the previous commit. I
              use this command often because I find myself often committing too
              early and needing to add the current code into my last commit. So
              I decided to create an alias for it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I assigned the command to "ag" and now all I type is "git ag" and
              it ammends my git!
            </p>

            <p>
              Git aliases are a small portion of Git. And I understand if this
              post wasn't the most groundbreaking
