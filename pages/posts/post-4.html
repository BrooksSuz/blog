							<h2>Guard Clauses</h2>
							<span>Sep 30th, 2023</span>
						</div>
						<p>
							I, presumably like many others, first began my coding journey by
							using a lot of if-else statements. Later, I discovered how handy
							built-in methods could be and how they reduce the need for
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming"
								target="_blank"
								>imperative code</a
							>. Now I try to write more
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"
								target="_blank"
								>declarative code</a
							>
							whenever I can. That being said, imperative code is still useful
							in specific contexts. If-else statements are great for readability
							when used sparingly.
						</p>

						<p>
							Very quickly I learned that there's some contention toward using
							the else keyword. I adapted to using only the if keyword early on,
							but never fully understood why I needed to make that change.
						</p>

						<p>
							I've recently bettered my understanding of why the else keyword
							isn't used by many developers today. Today's post will touch on
							why it's a good idea to remove the else keyword from if-else
							statements.
						</p>

						<p>
							As a <span class="strong-phrase">tiny</span> disclosure, there is
							no one correct way to code. The words that follow simply describe
							where I stand currently and how I personally write code.
						</p>

						<p>
							To begin, this is by no means new information. Jeff Atwood wrote
							about
							<a
								href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/flattening-arrow-code/"
								target="_blank"
								>arrow code and guard clauses</a
							>
							a long time ago.
						</p>

						<p>
							Firstly, I can't simply remove the else keyword from a codebase
							and have it function exactly as it would without the keyword
							there. Doing so would (understandably) break the code. So I need
							to change how the code is written.
						</p>

						<p>
							Normally within if-else statements, the "main" code is written in
							the if block while the corner case is written in the else block.
							However, without the else keyword, the corner case will be moved
							into the if block while the "main" code is placed in the current
							scope directly below the if block. This also requires there to be
							an exit statement at the end of the if block so the code doesn't
							continue to run. Usually this is a blank return statement. But
							I've also used the continue keyword to exit the current iteration
							of a loop.
						</p>

						<p>
							There are great benefits to writing if-else statements this way.
							Firstly, the "main" code and the corner case code are no longer
							coupled together. If the corner case is met, then it will run that
							code. It's as simple as that. Removing tightly coupled code leads
							to a cleaner and less bug-ridden codebase.
						</p>

						<p>
							Secondly, it just makes sense (as lazy as that sounds). At first
							thought, putting the "main" code before any corner cases feels
							intuitive. The "main" code is the star of the show, so why put it
							before code that won't be run as often? As it turns out,
							displaying the less desirable path first shows the developer
							reading the code the exceptions to the code upfront. This
							encourages the developer to understand the less common outcomes
							before they understand the main functionality of the code. Again,
							this is very helpful for identifying and removing bugs.
						</p>

						<p>
							Finally, there is less nesting. Nesting is great for
							organization...until it isn't. It's easy to slip into what Atwood
							calls arrow code when there is an overreliance on if-else
							statements. Using guard clauses actually removes the "main" code
							from being nested in an if block and brings it out into the scope
							that the developer is currently working within.
						</p>

						<p>
							Generally speaking, guard clauses keep code clean. Codebases that
							contains guard clauses use less code (which is generally a good
							goal to strive for) and reduce nesting where it's unnecessary to
							do so.
						</p>

						<p>
							For developers that struggle to keep their code clean, and aren't
							currently using guard clauses, give them a shot! They have
							certainly helped me keep my code cleaner and easier to read.
