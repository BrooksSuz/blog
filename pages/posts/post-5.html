							<h2>Interpreted & Compiled Languages</h2>
							<span>Oct 14th, 2023</span>
						</div>
						<p>
							For longer than I'd like to admit, I didn't know the differences
							between an
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language"
								target="_blank"
								>interpreted (AKA scripting) language</a
							>
							and a
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language"
								target="_blank"
								>compiled language</a
							>. I always knew there were differences, but I never fully grasped
							them. Now that my understanding of the two is much stronger, I'm
							willing to help others understand!
						</p>

						<p>
							As a disclaimer, the terms "interpreted" and "compiled" only exist
							at a semantic level. Any programming language can be interpreted
							or compiled (that is, if the appropriate tools exist). What ends
							up defining whether a language is interpreted or compiled is:
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>A language's strengths/weaknesses.</li>
							<li>The community's use of a language.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							I'll use Python as an example. Python is mainly translated into
							intermediate code (explained later). Then, the code gets
							interpreted. However, Python may also be compiled by using tools
							like
							<a
								href="https://cython.org/"
								target="_blank"
								>Cython</a
							>
							if it makes sense for the context in which it's used. If compiled
							Python development were to become more popular than interpreted
							development, it's likely the Python community would describe
							Python as a compiled language rather than an interpreted one.
						</p>

						<p>
							I'll discuss both language types simultaneously, starting with how
							they differ in the execution process.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let's begin with interpreted languages. An interpreted language
							(JavaScript, PHP, and so on) requires source code to be accessible
							at runtime. This human-written code is translated into machine
							code. Then, it's immediately executed line by line. Execution
							begins at the top of the source code. In this context, the source
							code is referred to as a script. The interpreter works down the
							script until there is nothing left to interpret and execute.
						</p>

						<p>
							A compiled language (C, C++, and so on) takes source code and runs
							it through a compiler. The compiler's job is to translate
							human-written code straight into machine code. The result is an
							executable file that is readable by the computer's Central
							Processing Unit (CPU). Running the executable file will execute
							the code.
						</p>

						<p>
							It's worth noting that sometimes both interpreted and compiled
							languages will get translated into what's called
							<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation"
								target="_blank"
								>intermediate code</a
							>. Intermediate code is simply a bridge or a "halfway" point
							between human-written code and machine code.
							<a
								href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/js/index.html"
								target="_blank"
								>Mozilla's Spidermonkey engine</a
							>, used to power Firefox, makes use of intermediate code to
							shorten execution time.
						</p>

						<p>Back to the topic at hand.</p>

						<p>
							Executable files are platform-specific. An executable file in a
							Windows environment will not work in a macOS environment without
							some tweaking. This means compiled languages are restricted to the
							environment they can execute within. Thus, making them less
							portable than interpreted languages.
						</p>

						<p>
							On the other hand, interpreted languages are considered to be more
							portable. Most interpreters are created with various operating
							systems and hardware architecture in mind. This allows interpreted
							languages to be run in a multitude of computer environments. For
							example, JavaScript is the language that dominates the web. Web
							browsers contain interpreters to run JavaScript. So long as a
							computer user has access to a web browser, they can execute
							JavaScript code. Spidermonkey contains an interpreter, as well as
							<a
								href="https://v8.dev/"
								target="_blank"
								>Google's V8 JavaScript engine</a
							>
							that powers Google Chrome.
						</p>

						<p>
							If these were the only differences, there wouldn't be an argument
							to work with compiled code (outside of maintaining legacy
							codebases that use compiled languages). However, this isn't where
							the differences end!
						</p>

						<p>
							Compiled languages undoubtedly execute quicker than interpreted
							languages. Simply put, compiled languages translate to machine
							code before runtime. Thus, there is less to do during runtime.
							Assuming there is time to compile the code before running it,
							compiled languages will generally be faster than interpreted
							languages.
						</p>

						<p>
							Unfortunately, interpreted languages lack the speed that compiled
							languages gain from translating source code to machine code before
							runtime. Though interpreted languages are generally slower during
							execution, it doesn't necessarily mean these languages are worse
							off because of the added translation step during runtime.
						</p>

						<p>
							Interpreted languages report errors in terms of the source code.
							This makes debugging easier compared to compiled languages. Also,
							the developer doesn't have to wait for code to compile only to
							find bugs that need to be addressed. The developer can run code
							quickly over and over again until they are finished debugging.
						</p>

						<p>
							Compiled languages generally aren't as easy to debug. They compile
							the code and then run the code. Because of this, the developer
							doesn't have the same visibility into the program's behavior
							compared to interpreted languages.
						</p>

						<p>
							Compiled languages may not be as easy to debug. However, they are
							generally considered more secure. Compiled languages require
							machine code at runtime. This is great for security. As it turns
							out, most people aren't very good at programming machine code!
							This complexity adds additional security to compiled codebases.
						</p>

						<p>
							Due to source code being required at runtime for interpreted
							languages, they are much easier to modify if someone with
							malicious intentions is able to get their hands on the code. In
							modern codebases, this is less of an issue. That being said, it's
							still something to keep in mind for those coding in interpreted
							languages.
						</p>

						<p>
							At this point, I've covered most of the differences between the
							two types of programming languages. Like most things in life, one
							of these types isn't inherently better than the other. They both
							have contexts where they work the best.
						</p>

						<p>
							I've mainly used interpreted languages for the work that I've
							found myself in. That being said, I'd love to get more experience
							with compiled languages in the future!
