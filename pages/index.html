      <h2>JavaScript Injected CSS</h2>
      <p>
        I have been working my first job as a developer, and it has been such a great experience! My first project with the company was updating an old search modal the company uses for their salable products.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project has taken me a little over a week to get all of the JavaScript working properly and to style the modal along the way. Styling has become one of my favorite parts of the web development process.
      </p>

      <p>
        In working on this project, I had attempted to insert a simple animation that would make the modal slowly expand when the HTML elements inside of it would be filled.
