						<h2>Home</h2>

						<p>HELLO!</p>

						<p>My name is Brooks Susor. This is my humble blog.</p>

						<p>
							This is a tech-focused blog with an emphasis on anything and
							everything web development. My goals with this blog are to:
						</p>

						<ul style="list-style: disc; list-style-position: inside">
							<li>
								Share what I know to help others interested in web development
								and tech.
							</li>
							<li>
								Reinforce my own understandings of the things I have learned
								along the way.
							</li>
							<li>
								Provide myself with a creative outlet that I have been missing
								since college.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							I must say, I am in the early stages of creating this blog. I am
							also in the early stages of my career as a developer. I will
							convey the information that I have learned to the best of my
							ability. However, I may not fully understand a concept. I may
							phrase something incorrectly. Please take everything that I write
							with a grain of salt.
						</p>

						<p>
							I hope the topics I choose to write about are beneficial to you in
							one way or another.
						</p>

						<p>ENJOY!</p>
